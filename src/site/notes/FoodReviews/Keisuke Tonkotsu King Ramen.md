**Visit date:** [[2022-06-20\|2022-06-20]]
**Price:** SGD 15.90++

# Highlights
- Soup broth is thick, fragrant, clean and flavourful
- Chashu is thin and tender, not chewy
- Noodles texture is just nice
- Order chit allows customisation a la Ichiran style (soft/hard noodles, light/normal/thick broth)
- Free hard-boiled eggs on table

# Good
- Seaweed is crispy enough
- Own brand soft drinks - green tea cola and yuzu cola tried, sakura cola not tried

# Bad
- Space is small, not many seats, need to time properly if not there will be a queue
