# Comment tip
> I couldn't use a blender so I used an electric mixer instead! It also makes smooth pulp, just mix it for a while. I couldn't use the blender because we needed it for food, so using the electric mixer really helped since it's just easy to wash. For some reason my paper wouldn't stick to the cloth after I use the sponge on my deckle ðŸ˜­ instead I just put the cloth directly on top of the paper then used the sponge on the cloth, it did stuck on the cloth so things worked out in the end.
