## Ingredients

-   12 oz of dairy-free semi-sweet chocolate chips
-   12 oz of silken tofu
-   1 Tbsp pure vanilla extract
-   1 c oat milk (or other non-dairy milk of your choice)
-   Generous pinch of salt, to taste

## Directions

#### Melting The Vegan Chocolate

1.  Place the vegan chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl.
2.  Place the bowl into the microwave and cook for 30 sec on high power.
3.  Remove the chocolate bowl from the microwave, and stir.
4.  Place the bowl back into the microwave. Cook for another 30 sec on high power.
5.  Remove your bowl again, and stir the chocolate chips.
6.  Keep microwaving your chocolate chips on high power in 10-sec increments. Stir after each increment.
7.  Keep cooking until the chocolate is smooth and fully melted. Cool for 5 min.

#### Constructing Your Ice Cream

1.  Put the silken tofu in a blender and process until very smooth.
2.  Add the melted chocolate and blend until well combined. Stop and wipe down the sides of the blender with a spatula, as needed.
3.  Add the oat milk, vanilla extract, and salt. Puree until smooth.
4.  Remove from the blender. Cover the chocolate mixture and let it chill in the refrigerator for a minimum of 1 hr.
5.  Take the mixture out of the fridge, and pour it into an Ice Cream Maker. Churn your ice cream according to the manufacturer's instructions.
6.  Enjoy your dairy-free ice cream immediately as a soft-serve texture. For hard ice cream, pack it into a freezer-safe container and place in the freezer until it becomes solid.
