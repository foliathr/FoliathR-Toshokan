## Ingredients:
- Tofu: 200g 
- Honey: 4 tbsp 
- Heavy cream: 80 ml 
> [!Tip] Tip
> Add anything you want to add more depth in the flavor such as: 
>- Black sesame seeds: 4 tbsp 
>- Soybean powder: 3 tbsp 
>- Cinnamon: 1 tbsp 
>Only your mind sets the limits here ;) 

## How to make it: 
1. Dry the tofu using kitchen paper which you wrap it in. 
2. Microwave it for 2 min at 600W. 
3. Dry it using new kitchen paper and put a weight on it to help it get rid of the water quicker. 
4. Mix it with the honey. 
5. Mix in the heavy cream. 
6. Add anything else if wanted otherwise freeze it for 1 hour. 
7. Stir it, freeze it for one more hour, then stir and freeze for 6 hours. 

> [!Tip]
> if you have a hand mixer then you don't need to take it out of the freezer twice, just leave it in the freezer after mixing the ingredients.
